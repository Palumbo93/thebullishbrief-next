# User Account Deletion Fix

## Problem Statement

When users attempt to delete their accounts, the system fails with a "Database error deleting user" error. This occurs because several database tables have `user_id` columns that reference user data but lack proper foreign key constraints with `ON DELETE CASCADE` behavior.

### Current Issues

1. **Missing Foreign Key Constraints**: Tables like `bookmarks`, `article_views`, and potentially others have `user_id` columns without proper foreign key constraints to `auth.users` or `user_profiles`.

2. **Orphaned Records**: When a user is deleted from `auth.users`, related records in these tables remain orphaned, causing database integrity issues. Analytics data (views) should be preserved with `user_id` set to NULL.

3. **Cascade Deletion Not Working**: The current cascade deletion only works for tables with proper foreign key constraints (like `user_profiles`, `article_comments`, `bull_room_messages`, `bull_room_reactions`). Analytics data should be preserved with `user_id` set to NULL.

## Solution Design

### 1. Add Missing Foreign Key Constraints

We need to add foreign key constraints to the following tables:

- `bookmarks.user_id` â†’ `user_profiles.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `article_views.user_id` â†’ `user_profiles.id` (ON DELETE SET NULL)
- `brief_views.user_id` â†’ `user_profiles.id` (ON DELETE SET NULL)

### 2. Database Migration Strategy

Create a new migration that:

1. Adds the missing foreign key constraints
2. Handles existing orphaned records:
   - Delete orphaned bookmarks (user-specific data)
   - Set orphaned view records to NULL (preserve analytics data)
3. Ensures data integrity before adding constraints

### 3. Edge Function Enhancement

Update the delete-user Edge Function to:

1. Add better error handling and logging
2. Provide more specific error messages
3. Add a cleanup step for any remaining orphaned records

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema Fix
1. Create migration to add missing foreign key constraints
2. Handle existing orphaned data
3. Test the migration in development

### Phase 2: Edge Function Enhancement
1. Improve error handling in the delete-user function
2. Add comprehensive logging
3. Test the enhanced function

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
1. Test user deletion with various data scenarios
2. Verify cascade deletion works correctly
3. Ensure no orphaned records remain

## Technical Details

### Tables Requiring Foreign Key Constraints

```sql
-- Bookmarks table
ALTER TABLE bookmarks 
ADD CONSTRAINT bookmarks_user_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Article views table  
ALTER TABLE article_views
ADD CONSTRAINT article_views_user_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Brief views table
ALTER TABLE brief_views
ADD CONSTRAINT brief_views_user_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_profiles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

### Handling Existing Orphaned Data

Before adding constraints, we need to clean up existing orphaned records:

```sql
-- Delete orphaned bookmarks
DELETE FROM bookmarks 
WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM user_profiles);

-- Set orphaned article views to NULL (preserve analytics data)
UPDATE article_views 
SET user_id = NULL 
WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM user_profiles);

-- Set orphaned brief views to NULL (preserve analytics data)
UPDATE brief_views 
SET user_id = NULL 
WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM user_profiles);
```

## Success Criteria

1. âœ… User account deletion completes successfully without database errors
2. âœ… All user-related data is properly cascaded and deleted
3. âœ… No orphaned records remain in the database
4. âœ… The system maintains referential integrity
5. âœ… Edge Function provides clear error messages if issues occur

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: This is a schema fix that adds constraints to ensure data integrity. The main risk is handling existing orphaned data, which we'll address by cleaning it up before adding constraints.

**Rollback Plan**: If issues occur, we can:
1. Drop the foreign key constraints
2. Revert the migration
3. Investigate and fix any data issues before retrying

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test the migration on a copy of production data
2. **Integration Tests**: Test user deletion with various data scenarios
3. **Manual Testing**: Test the complete user deletion flow in development
4. **Data Validation**: Verify no orphaned records remain after deletion

## Implementation Summary

### âœ… Completed Fixes

1. **Database Schema Fix**:
   - Added missing foreign key constraints for `bookmarks`, `article_views`, and `brief_views`
   - Implemented proper cascade behavior (DELETE for user data, SET NULL for analytics)
   - Cleaned up existing orphaned data

2. **Bull Rooms Table Fix**:
   - Ensured `bull_rooms` table exists before foreign key constraints are created
   - Fixed migration order issue that was causing "relation bull_rooms does not exist" errors
   - Added proper table structure with indexes, constraints, and RLS policies

3. **Edge Function Enhancement**:
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Added more specific error messages
   - Enhanced debugging capabilities

### ðŸŽ¯ Root Cause Resolution

The original error "Database error deleting user" was caused by:
1. **Missing foreign key constraints** on user-related tables
2. **Migration order issues** where `bull_rooms` table didn't exist when referenced
3. **Orphaned data** that couldn't be properly cleaned up during user deletion

The fix ensures proper referential integrity and cascade behavior, allowing user account deletion to complete successfully while preserving important analytics data.
