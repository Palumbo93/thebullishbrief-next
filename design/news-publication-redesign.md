## Problem Statement

The current site architecture is designed as a specialized financial content platform with a complex sidebar-based navigation system. We need to transform it into a standard news publication design similar to The New York Times, focusing on simplicity, accessibility, and traditional publishing patterns that users expect from news websites.

**Core Value:** Provide users with a familiar, clean news reading experience that prioritizes content discovery and consumption over platform-specific features.

**Key Requirements:**
1. Replace sidebar navigation with traditional header navigation on desktop
2. Consolidate all content into a unified publication experience (briefs and articles treated the same)
3. Simplify the visual design by removing dark theme and featured content styling
4. Eliminate engagement features like comments and view counts
5. Maintain mobile experience with existing sidebar pattern

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Layout System
- **Current:** Fixed sidebar (80px) + main content + conditional right panel (400px)
- **Mobile:** Header (56px) + drawer sidebar + full-width content
- **Key Files:** `Layout.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `AppContent.tsx`

### Navigation Structure
- **Current:** Icon-based vertical sidebar with: Home, Explore, Bull Room, AI Prompts, Admin
- **Auth:** Login/signup buttons in sidebar, user avatar with dropdown menu

### Content Types
- **Articles:** Full editorial content with comments, bookmarks, featured styling
- **Briefs:** Company-focused content with action panels, tickers, video widgets
- **Current Pages:** Home (filtered content), Categories, Article/Brief pages

### Theme System
- **Current:** Light/dark theme toggle via `ThemeContext`
- **Components:** Multiple theme-aware components throughout codebase

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Header-Based Navigation (Desktop)

**Layout Structure:**
```
[Logo] [Nav Items] [Search] [Subscribe]
```
*Note: Login functionality removed from UI (backlogged)*

**Navigation Items:**
- Home (/) - Main feed
- Dynamic categories based on existing article categories from database
- Categories will be populated from current category data table system

**Header Behavior:**
- **Standard Pages:** Full header with logo, nav items, search, subscribe
- **Article/Brief Pages:** Condensed header with logo, search, subscribe only
- **Mobile:** Maintain current sidebar drawer pattern with updated content structure

### 2. Content Consolidation

**Unified Content Model:**
- Treat briefs and articles as the same content type to users
- Featured briefs appear in standard article listing
- Remove brief-specific UI elements (action panels, ticker widgets)
- Single article page template for both content types

**Page Structure:**
- **Home Page:** Traditional publication homepage with article grid
- **Category Pages:** Filtered article listings by category  
- **Article Pages:** Clean article reading experience
- **Search:** Maintain existing search page experience

### 3. Visual Simplification

**Theme System:**
- Remove dark theme entirely
- Standardize on light theme with traditional publication colors
- Update CSS variables to single theme values

**Content Styling:**
- Remove featured article highlighting
- Standardize article card design
- Remove view counts and comment indicators
- Clean, minimalist article page layout

### 4. Feature Removal

**Comments System:**
- Remove `ArticleComments` component
- Remove comment-related state management
- Remove comment database interactions

**Engagement Features:**
- Remove view count displays
- Remove featured content styling
- Simplify bookmark functionality (keep core feature)

**Brief-Specific Features:**
- Remove action panels (`BriefsActionPanel`)
- Remove ticker widgets
- Remove video integration widgets
- Remove company-specific metadata displays

   - Maintain mobile layout unchanged

### Phase 2: Navigation & Content

   - Implement NYTimes-style header
   - Add dynamic category-based navigation from database
   - Integrate search and subscribe popup (remove login for now)

   - Responsive design testing
   - Performance optimization

2. **Content Migration**

   - Test category filtering
   - Verify search functionality

## Technical Considerations

### Breaking Changes
- `ThemeContext` removal affects all theme-aware components
- Layout changes affect page-specific styling
- Component removal requires cleanup of imports and dependencies

### Database Impact

- Brief and article content remains separate in database
- Only presentation layer changes

### Performance Impact
- Reduced bundle size from removed components
- Simplified CSS reduces style calculations
- Fewer layout shifts from fixed sidebar removal

### Mobile Compatibility
- No changes to mobile experience
- Existing responsive design patterns maintained
- Mobile drawer sidebar unchanged

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Layout System Changes:** Complete restructure of desktop navigation
- **Theme Removal:** Affects all components with theme-aware styling

### Medium Risk
- **Feature Removal:** May impact user expectations and workflows
- **Content Consolidation:** Requires careful handling of different content types

### Low Risk
- **Visual Simplification:** Primarily CSS changes
- **Mobile Unchanged:** No mobile experience disruption

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Faster page load times due to simplified components
- Reduced cognitive load from cleaner interface
- Improved content discoverability through traditional navigation

### Technical
- Reduced bundle size (target: 20% reduction)
- Simplified component tree
- Improved maintainability through code removal

### Content

## Dependencies

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1:** 2-3 days (foundation changes)
- **Phase 2:** 3-4 days (navigation & content)
- **Phase 3:** 2-3 days (feature removal)
- **Phase 4:** 1-2 days (polish & testing)

**Total Estimated Duration:** 8-12 days
