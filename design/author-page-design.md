# Author Page Design

## Problem Statement
We need to create an Author page that displays detailed information about an author, their articles, and provides a comprehensive profile view. This page should follow our minimalist black, white & grey design system and provide a clean, professional author profile experience.

## Requirements

### Core Features
- **Author Profile Section**: Display author avatar, name, bio, and social links
- **Author Statistics**: Show article count, total views, and featured status
- **Author's Articles**: List all articles by the author with pagination
- **Social Links**: LinkedIn, Twitter, and website links if available
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach following our design system

### Data Requirements
- Author information (name, bio, avatar, social links, stats)
- Author's articles with metadata (title, subtitle, date, views, category)
- Featured status and article count
- Total views across all articles

### Design Guidelines
- Follow the minimalist black, white & grey theme from `design-system.css`
- Use consistent spacing and typography from the design system
- Maintain clean, icon-free interface as per user preferences
- Match the layout patterns from existing pages (HomePage, SearchPage, ArticlePage)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Integration
- Use existing `AuthorService` from `database.ts`
- Create new hook `useAuthorBySlug` for fetching author data
- Leverage existing `useArticles` hook for author's articles

### Component Structure
```
AuthorPage
├── AuthorHeader (avatar, name, bio, social links)
├── AuthorStats (article count, total views, featured status)
├── AuthorArticles (list of articles with pagination)
└── Loading/Error states
```

### Route Structure
- URL pattern: `/authors/:slug`
- Handle 404 for non-existent authors
- SEO-friendly URLs using author slugs

### State Management
- Loading states for author data and articles
- Error handling for missing authors
- Pagination for author's articles list

## Success Criteria
